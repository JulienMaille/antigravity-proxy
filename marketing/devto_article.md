Antigravity 2.0 is Google's agentic coding IDE. It gives AI agents filesystem access, MCP tools, subagent orchestration, and browser automation. It's powerful — but locked to Gemini.

I wanted to use other models. So I built a proxy.

## The problem

Antigravity sends massive inline context with every request: 30+ skill descriptions, full plugin lists, user rules, agent frameworks — around 4000 tokens of boilerplate. External models can't parse this effectively. And Antigravity Desktop requires specific response metadata (`safetyRatings`, `index: 0`, `groundingMetadata`) that OpenAI-format APIs don't provide.

## The solution

A TypeScript TLS proxy (~400 lines) that sits between Antigravity and your model provider:

```
Antigravity → Proxy (443) → OpenAI API → NVIDIA / OpenRouter
```

### Key features

1. **Context stripping**: Removes the ~4000 tokens of inline skills/plugins/rules and injects a compact reference to `agent-context.md` (a ~150-line runtime definition file)

2. **Bidirectional translation**: Converts Google-format messages, tools, and streaming to OpenAI-format and back

3. **Desktop metadata**: Adds `safetyRatings`, `groundingMetadata`, and `index: 0` to every response — without these, Antigravity Desktop silently crashes

4. **429 retry**: Exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s) for rate limits

5. **Arg sanitization**: Strips Antigravity's internal metadata fields (`toolAction`, `toolSummary`) from tool call arguments

### What works

Everything except audio and background project sync. Chat, code gen, file operations (`view_file`, `write_to_file`, `list_dir`, `grep_search`, `run_command`), browser automation (Chrome DevTools MCP — open browser, screenshot, console check, JS evaluation), image generation, subagent orchestration, streaming, thinking/reasoning.

### The test

I asked the agent to build a landing page for Antigravity 2.0. It:
1. Read `agent-context.md` to understand the runtime
2. Created `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` with a particle system, terminal animation, and interactive UI
3. Opened the page in Chrome via the browser MCP tool
4. Took a full-page screenshot
5. Checked browser console for errors
6. Evaluated JavaScript to verify animations and counters were running
7. Reported results with visual feedback

All through `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash` on NVIDIA NIM. Not a single Google API call.

### Setup

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/12errh/antigravity-proxy
cd antigravity-proxy
.\setup.ps1
```

Pick NVIDIA or OpenRouter, paste your API key. The script handles admin elevation, dependencies, TLS certificates, and proxy startup.

To change models, edit `proxy/models.json`:

```json
{
  "claude-sonnet-4-6-thinking": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash",
  "default": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash"
}
```

### Supported providers

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| NVIDIA NIM | `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash`, `stepfun-ai/step-3.7-flash` |
| OpenRouter | Any OpenAI-compatible model |

### Limitations

- **Audio**: Not mapped yet
- **Background project sync**: Language Server init calls to Google need a Gemini key (sidebar file tree, etc.)

Everything else works transparently.
